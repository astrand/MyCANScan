Automatically setting up CANUSB device file on Linux
====================================================
If you plug the Lawicel CANUSB into a Linux system, you will typically
get a device file called /dev/ttyUSB0 or something like that. There
are two problems:

1) The device is only accessible by root. Solution: Create
/etc/security/console.perms.d/10-canusb.perms with:

<ttyCAN>=/dev/ttyCAN
<console>  0600 <ttyCAN>      0660 root.uucp


2) The device name can differ. MyCanScan uses /dev/ttyCAN by
default. Solution: Create /etc/udev/rules.d/10-canusb.rules with:

# Lawicel CANUSB but also MANY OTHER DEVICES
SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{idProduct}=="6001", KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", SYMLINK+="ttyCAN"

This configuration has been tested on Fedora 7.
